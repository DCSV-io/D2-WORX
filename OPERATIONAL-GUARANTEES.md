# OPERATIONAL-GUARANTEES.md — D²-WORX Correctness & Safety

How D²-WORX prevents duplicate actions, ensures idempotency, and maintains correct behavior across services, instances, and scheduled jobs.

---

## Idempotency

### HTTP Idempotency (Gateway)

- **Mechanism:** `Idempotency-Key` header middleware on the .NET REST Gateway
- **Storage:** Redis `SET NX` with 24-hour TTL — shared across all gateway instances
- **Behavior:** First request with a given key is processed normally and the response is cached. Subsequent requests with the same key return the cached response without re-executing the handler
- **Scope:** External-facing mutations only. Internal service-to-service calls (gRPC, RabbitMQ) use different guarantees
- **Packages:** `@d2/idempotency` (Node.js), `Idempotency.Default` (.NET)

### Content-Addressable Entities (Geo)

- `Location` and `WhoIs` entities use SHA-256 content-addressable hash IDs (64-char hex)
- Identical input always produces the same ID — `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes creation inherently idempotent
- No duplicate data regardless of how many times the same entity is created

### Contacts (Auth → Geo)

- Contacts use UUIDv7 IDs (not content-addressable) but are immutable once created
- "Update" is modeled as create-new → repoint junction → delete-old, preserving cache validity across all consumers
- Org contact junction metadata (label, isPrimary) can be updated in place since it's org-owned, not contact data

## Scheduled Jobs (Dkron)

### No Duplicate Execution

Each of the 8 daily maintenance jobs uses a **Redis distributed lock** (`SET NX PX`) to ensure only one instance processes a job at any given time:

| Job | Service | Lock TTL | Retention |
| --- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| `purge-stale-whois` | Geo | Configurable | 180 days |
| `cleanup-orphaned-locations` | Geo | Configurable | Zero references |
| `purge-sessions` | Auth | Configurable | Expired sessions |
| `purge-sign-in-events` | Auth | Configurable | 90 days |
| `cleanup-invitations` | Auth | Configurable | 7 days post-expiry |
| `cleanup-emulation-consents` | Auth | Configurable | Expired/revoked |
| `purge-deleted-messages` | Comms | Configurable | 90 days |
| `purge-delivery-history` | Comms | Configurable | 365 days |

**Execution flow:** Dkron (cron trigger) → HTTP POST to REST Gateway (service key auth) → Gateway forwards via gRPC (API key credentials) → Service handler acquires Redis lock → Batch delete loop → Release lock → Return result

**If the lock is held:** The handler returns early with a success result (no error, no retry). The job is simply skipped on that instance. This is safe because all jobs are periodic cleanup — the next scheduled run will process any remaining records.

### Batch Processing

All purge/cleanup jobs use `CHUNK(batch_size)` to process records in batches (default 500), avoiding long-running transactions and large `IN` clauses. Batch size is configurable via the Options pattern.

### Staggered Scheduling

Jobs are staggered 15 minutes apart (2:00–3:45 AM UTC) to avoid resource contention.

## Rate Limiting

### No Per-Instance Counters

All rate limiting uses **Redis-backed shared counters** — never per-process `Map` objects.

- **Packages:** `@d2/ratelimit` (Node.js), `RateLimit.Default` (.NET)
- **Algorithm:** Sliding window approximation (two fixed-window counters + weighted average)
- **Atomicity:** Redis `INCR` + `TTL` — atomic operations, no cross-instance coordination needed
- **Dimensions:** ClientFingerprint (100/min), IP (5,000/min), City (25,000/min), Country (100,000/min)
- **Blocking:** If ANY dimension exceeds threshold → block for 5 minutes
- **Fail-open:** If Redis is down or WhoIs unavailable, requests pass through (availability over strictness)
- **Trusted bypass:** Service-key authenticated requests (`X-Api-Key`) bypass all rate limit dimensions

### Country Whitelist

US, CA, GB are exempt from country-level blocking to avoid false positives from CDN/proxy aggregation.

## Session Consistency

### Multi-Instance Safety

| Tier | Storage | Behavior |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| Cookie cache (5min) | In cookie | Travels with the request — any instance can decode |
| Redis | Shared | Any instance queries the same Redis — instant revocation |
| PostgreSQL | Shared | Dual-write ensures durability + audit trail |

**No sticky sessions required.** Any instance can handle any request. Session revocation propagates instantly via Redis. The only lag is the cookie cache TTL (~5 minutes max on the device that has the session cached).

### JWT Validation

- JWTs are self-contained — any instance validates with the cached JWKS public key
- JWKS endpoint (`/api/auth/jwks`) is database-backed — all auth instances serve the same keys
- Key rotation (30-day cycle, 30-day grace) is database-driven, not instance-specific
- JWT expiration: 15 minutes — limits the window of a revoked-but-still-valid token

---

## Messaging (RabbitMQ)

### Competing Consumers

- RabbitMQ queues use **competing consumers** — each message is delivered to exactly one consumer instance
- No duplicate processing of queue messages under normal operation
- If a consumer crashes mid-processing, the message is requeued and picked up by another instance

### Fanout for Cache Invalidation

- Cache invalidation signals use **fanout exchanges** with exclusive auto-delete queues per instance
- Every instance receives every invalidation signal — ensures all local caches are refreshed
- This is the correct pattern: invalidation must reach all instances, not just one

### Delivery Deduplication (Comms)

- Each notification gets a unique `correlationId` for cross-service tracking
- Delivery attempts are recorded in the database — duplicate delivery detection uses unique constraints on `(delivery_request_id, channel, attempt_number)`
- DB constraint violations (PG error `23505`) are caught and treated as no-ops, not errors

---

## Request Enrichment

### Deterministic Output

- Request enrichment is **stateless middleware** — resolves client IP, computes fingerprint, calls Geo WhoIs cache
- Identical input always produces identical output regardless of which instance processes the request
- No instance affinity required

---

## Multi-Instance Scaling Checklist

When adding a new service or endpoint, verify:

- [ ] **Rate limiting** — Use `@d2/ratelimit` (Redis-backed) or `.NET RateLimit.Default`, never per-process Maps
- [ ] **Idempotency** — Use Redis-backed `@d2/idempotency` for external-facing mutations
- [ ] **Session/auth** — Validate JWTs via JWKS (no instance affinity), sessions via Redis
- [ ] **Local caches** — Memory caches are per-instance (fine for read-heavy, TTL-bounded data). Correctness must not depend on cache consistency across instances
- [ ] **Background jobs** — Use Dkron + Redis distributed locks (`SET NX`). Return early if lock is held
- [ ] **Cache invalidation** — Use fanout exchanges with exclusive auto-delete queues (not competing consumers)
- [ ] **Connection strings** — Externalized via config/environment, not hardcoded
- [ ] **DB constraints** — Catch unique violations (PG `23505`) gracefully — return 409, not 500

## Known Limitations

### Cookie Cache Revocation Lag

With cookie cache enabled, a revoked session may remain valid on the device that has it cached for up to 5 minutes (the `cookieCache.maxAge`). This is an acceptable tradeoff for eliminating ~95% of Redis lookups.

### Graceful Shutdown

RabbitMQ consumer is not drained before SIGTERM — in-flight messages may be lost. Tracked as outstanding item (requires `MessageBus.drain()` API). Low impact: all jobs are periodic and safe to re-run.

### Fail-Open Rate Limiting

If Redis is unavailable, rate limiting is skipped entirely (fail-open). This prioritizes availability over strictness. For environments requiring strict enforcement, add a circuit breaker that returns 503 when Redis is unreachable.
