# Comms Service

## Overview

The **Comms** (Communications) service is a standalone Node.js service that handles all outbound and conversational communication for D2-WORX. It is a **delivery engine** -- other services feed it requests via RabbitMQ, and it composes, formats, and delivers messages through the appropriate channels.

**Runtime:** Node.js (gRPC server + RabbitMQ consumer -- no HTTP framework)
**Database:** PostgreSQL (own schema, Drizzle ORM)
**Inbound:** RabbitMQ (transactional delivery) + gRPC server (conversational messaging + queries from .NET gateway)
**Outbound:** Email (SMTP/API), SMS (provider TBD), Push (gRPC client -> SignalR gateway)

> **No Hono / no HTTP.** Auth uses Hono because BetterAuth requires it. Comms has no direct HTTP surface -- all client-facing HTTP is handled by the .NET REST gateway, which calls Comms via gRPC. Comms only exposes RabbitMQ consumers and a gRPC server.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Senders send content, Comms handles presentation** -- Senders provide a universal notification shape: title + content (markdown) + plaintext (plain text fallback). Comms handles channel-specific presentation (HTML email wrapping via `marked` + `isomorphic-dompurify`, SMS truncation, push title+body). No per-event templates -- all notifications use the same shape.

2. **Fire-and-forget from the sender's perspective** -- Senders publish a RabbitMQ message and move on. Comms tracks delivery internally (success/failure/retry). Senders do NOT poll for delivery status.

3. **Async delivery feedback via SignalR gateway** -- When delivery outcomes matter to the UX (e.g., "your forum post was sent" or "message delivery failed"), Comms pushes status updates to the SignalR gateway via gRPC, which relays them to the connected client over WebSocket.

4. **Channel-agnostic at the sender API** -- Senders specify WHAT to send and WHO to send it to, not HOW. Comms resolves the recipient's channel preferences and fans out accordingly.

5. **Contacts-only recipient resolution** -- Recipients are resolved exclusively via contactId (Geo contact lookup). No userId-based resolution, no direct email/phone addresses. Callers must provide a contactId.

6. **RabbitMQ is the queue, PG is the audit log** -- Unlike DeCAF v3 which polled PG for retries, D2 uses RabbitMQ dead-letter exchanges for retry scheduling. PG stores delivery history for audit, analytics, and queryability.

## Sub-Domains

### 1. Delivery Engine (transactional notifications)

System-to-person messages triggered by application events. Examples:

- Email verification, password reset, invitation emails (from Auth)
- Order confirmation, shipping updates (from future services)
- System alerts, maintenance notices (from ops)

**Flow:**

```mermaid

    Sender["Sender\n(Auth, Geo, etc.)"]
    RMQ["RabbitMQ\ncomms.notifications"]
    Comms["Comms Service"]
    Resolve["Resolve Recipient\n(geo-client)"]
    Prefs["Check Channel\nPreferences"]
    PG[(PostgreSQL\naudit log)]

    Sender -->|publish| RMQ -->|consume| Comms
    Comms --> Resolve --> Prefs

    Prefs -->|email enabled| SMTP["SMTP / Email API"]
    Prefs -->|sms enabled| SMS["SMS API"]
    Prefs -->|push enabled| SignalR["gRPC -> SignalR\nGateway"]

    Comms -->|record attempt| PG

    SMTP -.->|failure| DLX["DLX -> Delayed Retry"]
    SMS -.->|failure| DLX
    DLX -.->|re-queue| RMQ
```

### 2. In-App Notifications

Lightweight notifications that appear in the app UI (bell icon). Not email/SMS -- just stored records the client fetches or receives via push.

- Title + description + read/unread state
- Linked to userId (no anonymous in-app notifs)
- Pushed to connected clients via SignalR gateway
- Paginated query API for notification history

### 3. Conversational Messaging (threads, live chat, forums)

Person-to-person or group conversations. Participants can be users OR contacts (non-users). Reached via the .NET REST gateway -> gRPC (NOT RabbitMQ -- user actions need synchronous responses).

- **Thread** -- a conversation container (type: `chat`, `support`, `forum`, etc.)
- **Participants** -- users and/or contacts, each with a role and mute toggle
- **Messages** -- markdown-formatted text within a thread, with file attachments and emoji reactions
- **Real-time** -- when a thread is actively viewed, new messages / edits / reactions push instantly to all viewers via SignalR gateway. Comms persists first, then pushes via gRPC.
- **Offline** -- no push. Users fetch thread history via paginated query when they open it. Unread state tracked via last-read timestamp per participant.

## Recipient Resolution

The `RecipientResolver` resolves a recipient's email/phone from a `contactId`. It uses the `@d2/geo-client` library to look up Geo contacts.

### Resolution Path

| Path          | When                        | Geo-Client Handler | Lookup Key                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **contactId** | `recipientContactId` is set | `GetContactsByIds` | Direct Geo contact UUID lookup |
| **neither**   | No recipient info           | --                 | Deliver returns NOT_FOUND      |

Callers are responsible for providing a contactId (resolved from their own domain). Comms does not perform userId-to-contact resolution -- that responsibility belongs to the sending service (e.g., Auth resolves userId -> contactId via ext-key lookup before publishing via `@d2/comms-client`).

### Channel Resolution

After resolving the recipient address, Deliver looks up channel preferences by `contactId`. Three rules control channel selection:

1. **`sensitive: true`** -- email ONLY (safety: tokens/PII must not leak via SMS)
2. **`urgency: "urgent"`** -- forces all channels (email + SMS), bypasses preferences
3. **`urgency: "normal"`** -- respects all channel preferences

No quiet hours. No requested-channels override. The `sensitive` and `urgency` fields on the Message entity are the only inputs to channel resolution.

### Known Limitation: SMS Without Provider

When `smsProvider` is undefined (not configured), SMS delivery attempts are created but remain in `"pending"` status indefinitely -- no dispatch occurs. This is acceptable during development/alpha but should be addressed before enabling SMS channels in production.

---

## Markdown Rendering

Transactional email content is rendered from markdown to sanitized HTML server-side using:

- **`marked`** (17.0.3) -- full CommonMark parser, synchronous rendering
- **`isomorphic-dompurify`** (2.36.0) -- XSS sanitization via DOMPurify

The Deliver handler calls `marked.parse()` to convert markdown content to raw HTML, then `DOMPurify.sanitize()` to strip dangerous tags/attributes. The sanitized HTML is wrapped in a simple email template with `{{title}}`, `{{body}}`, and `{{unsubscribeUrl}}` placeholders.

Plain text (`plainTextContent`) is used as-is for SMS and email plaintext fallback -- no rendering.

---

## Channels & Providers

| Channel | Protocol        | Provider               | Notes                                            |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Email   | HTTP API        | **Resend**             | Markdown -> HTML via marked + DOMPurify          |
| SMS     | HTTP API        | **Twilio**             | Plain text content, no HTML                      |
| Push    | gRPC -> SignalR | SignalR gateway (.NET) | Title + body, delivered to connected clients     |
| In-App  | DB + Push       | Local PG + SignalR     | Stored in `notification` table, pushed if online |

### SignalR Gateway

A **separate .NET service** that owns all WebSocket/SignalR connections. Comms (and other services) talk to it via gRPC to push real-time updates to connected clients.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Comms["Comms Service"]
    Auth["Auth Service"]
    GW["SignalR Gateway\n(.NET)"]
    Browser["Browser / Mobile"]

    Comms -->|gRPC| GW
    Auth -->|gRPC| GW
    GW -->|WebSocket| Browser
```

The gateway is a **dumb connection manager** -- it maps "send to user X" or "send to group Y" to the right WebSocket connections. No business logic. Comms owns what to send; the gateway owns how to deliver it in real-time.

**Gateway gRPC API** (tiny surface):

| RPC                | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `SendToUser`       | Push to all of a user's active connections |
| `SendToConnection` | Push to a specific anonymous connection    |
| `SendToGroup`      | Push to all connections in a room/group    |

Group join/leave is handled client-side -- when a user opens a thread, their SignalR client joins group `thread:{threadId}`. When they navigate away, they leave. The gateway manages group membership directly from client subscribe/unsubscribe events. Comms never manages connection state.

---

## RabbitMQ Topology

### Exchanges

| Exchange                 | Type   | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `comms.notifications`    | fanout | Inbound notification requests from any service  |
| `comms.retry.requeue`    | --     | Routes expired tier-queue messages back to main |
| `comms.retry.tier-{N}`   | --     | Tier delay queues (TTL-based retry scheduling)  |
| `comms.outcome` (future) | topic  | Delivery outcome callbacks (optional)           |

**Note:** Thread/conversational messaging does NOT use RabbitMQ. Thread operations go through gRPC (synchronous, user-initiated). RabbitMQ is only for transactional delivery (fire-and-forget side effects).

### Queue & Binding

All notifications go to `comms.notifications` fanout exchange (no routing key). The comms service binds a `comms.notifications` queue to this exchange.

### Retry Strategy

1. First delivery attempt: immediate
2. On transient failure: re-publish to tier queue (`comms.retry.tier-{N}`) with appropriate TTL
3. Tier TTLs: 5s -> 10s -> 30s -> 60s -> 5min (indexed by retry count)
4. After TTL expires, message dead-letters back to `comms.notifications` via `comms.retry.requeue` exchange
5. After max attempts (configurable, default 10): log error and drop message

Always ACK the original message -- retry is via re-publish to tier queues, not NACK/requeue.

---

## Real-Time Architecture

### Two Paths -- Transactional vs Conversational

Comms handles two fundamentally different communication patterns with different latency requirements and transport mechanisms:

#### Path 1: Transactional Delivery (side effects, seconds OK)

Examples: email verification, password reset, system alerts. Sender publishes to RabbitMQ and moves on. Fire-and-forget.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender as Sender (Auth, Geo, etc.)
    participant RMQ as RabbitMQ
    participant Comms as Comms Service
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant Email as SMTP / Email API
    participant SMS as SMS API
    participant SR as SignalR Gateway

    Sender->>RMQ: publish(delivery request)
    Note over Sender: fire-and-forget

    RMQ->>Comms: consume
    Comms->>Comms: resolve recipient + check preferences
    Comms->>PG: record message + delivery request

    par For each enabled channel
        Comms->>Email: send email
        Comms->>SMS: send SMS
        Comms->>SR: gRPC push (if online)
    end

    Comms->>PG: record delivery attempt(s)

    alt Transient failure
        Comms-->>RMQ: re-publish to tier queue (delayed retry)
    end
```

#### Path 2: Conversational Messaging (user actions, must feel instant)

Examples: forum post, chat message, support thread reply. Client gets synchronous response. All viewers get real-time push.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Browser
    participant GW as .NET REST Gateway
    participant Comms as Comms Service
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant SR as SignalR Gateway
    participant Viewers as Other Thread Viewers

    Client->>GW: HTTP POST /threads/{id}/messages
    GW->>Comms: gRPC PostMessage()
    Comms->>Comms: validate (permissions, content)
    Comms->>PG: persist message
    Comms->>GW: PostMessageResponse (200 + messageId)
    GW->>Client: HTTP 200

    Comms->>SR: gRPC SendToGroup("thread:{id}", message)
    SR->>Viewers: WebSocket push
    Note over Viewers: UI updates in real-time
```

**Key distinction:** Transactional delivery goes through **RabbitMQ** (no gateway, no HTTP -- it's a side effect of a service event). Conversational messaging goes through the **.NET REST gateway via gRPC** (user-initiated action that needs an immediate response).

### Comms Service Interfaces

Because of the two paths, the Comms service exposes **both**:

| Interface         | Transport | Purpose                                               |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| RabbitMQ consumer | AMQP      | Consumes transactional delivery requests              |
| gRPC server       | HTTP/2    | Serves conversational messaging RPCs from the gateway |
| gRPC client       | HTTP/2    | Pushes real-time updates TO the SignalR gateway       |

### Thread Messaging Flow (detailed)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User (Browser)
    participant SK as SvelteKit
    participant SR as SignalR Gateway
    participant GW as .NET REST Gateway
    participant Comms as Comms Service
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant Others as Other Viewers

    Note over User,SR: 1. User opens thread
    User->>SR: WebSocket connect
    User->>SR: join group "thread:{id}"

    Note over User,PG: 2. User posts a message
    User->>GW: HTTP POST /threads/{id}/messages
    GW->>Comms: gRPC PostMessage()
    Comms->>Comms: validate (permissions, content, rate limit)
    Comms->>PG: persist message
    Comms->>GW: PostMessageResponse (success + messageId)
    GW->>User: HTTP 200

    Note over Comms,Others: 3. Push to other viewers
    Comms->>SR: gRPC SendToGroup("thread:{id}", message)
    SR->>Others: WebSocket broadcast
    Note over Others: UI updates in real-time

    Note over User,SR: 4. User navigates away
    User->>SR: leave group "thread:{id}"
    Note over SR: remove from group (ephemeral)

    Note over User,PG: 5. Offline users
    Note right of User: No SignalR group = no push.<br/>Fetch thread history via HTTP<br/>on next visit. Unread state<br/>from last_read_at vs latest message.
```

### Message Format

All thread messages use **Markdown** for formatting:

- **Storage:** Raw markdown in `message.content` (PG text column)
- **Rendering:** Client-side in SvelteKit (e.g., `marked` or `markdown-it`)
- **Files:** Uploaded to MinIO, referenced as `![filename](minio-url)` in markdown
- **Sanitization:** Server-side on ingest (strip dangerous HTML), client-side on render (DOMPurify)
- **Benefits:** Simple storage (just text), flexible rendering, no rich-text editor complexity, file references are just URLs

This applies to forum posts, chat messages, support threads -- all the same format. Keeps both the sender experience and the rendering pipeline uniform.

### Delivery Outcome Feedback

For transactional delivery, senders are fire-and-forget. But when outcomes matter to the UX:

1. Sender includes `callbackTopic` in the delivery request (e.g., `"auth.delivery-outcome"`)
2. After delivery succeeds or permanently fails, Comms publishes an outcome event to `comms.outcome.{sender_service}` via RabbitMQ
3. The sending service can optionally consume this to update its own state
4. For connected users, Comms can also push delivery status via SignalR (e.g., "your invitation email was sent successfully")

---

## Client Libraries

### `@d2/comms-client` (Node.js)

Thin client library at `comms/client/` for publishing notification requests to the Comms service via RabbitMQ. Consuming services call a single `Notify` handler with a universal message shape; the Comms service resolves the recipient's address, picks channels, renders markdown, and delivers.

Mirrors the `@d2/geo-client` pattern: a service-owned client that lives alongside the service it fronts, registered into any consumer's DI container.

```typescript
import { addCommsClient } from "@d2/comms-client";

// Registration (composition root)
addCommsClient(services, { publisher: messageBus.publisher });

// Usage (from a DI scope)
import { INotifyKey } from "@d2/comms-client";

const notify = scope.resolve(INotifyKey);
await notify.handleAsync({
  recipientContactId: "01926a3b-...",
  title: "Verify your email",
  content: "Click [here](https://...) to verify.",
  plaintext: "Visit https://... to verify your email.",
  correlationId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  senderService: "auth",
});
```

**Universal message shape (`NotifyInput`):**

| Field                | Type                      | Required | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `recipientContactId` | `string` (UUID)           | Yes      | Geo contact ID -- the ONLY recipient identifier        |
| `title`              | `string` (max 255)        | Yes      | Email subject, SMS prefix, push title                  |
| `content`            | `string` (max 50,000)     | Yes      | Markdown body -- rendered to HTML for email            |
| `plaintext`          | `string` (max 50,000)     | Yes      | Plain text -- SMS body, email fallback                 |
| `sensitive`          | `boolean`                 | No       | Default `false`. When `true`, email only (secure)      |
| `urgency`            | `"normal"` \| `"urgent"`  | No       | Default `"normal"`. `"urgent"` bypasses prefs          |
| `correlationId`      | `string` (max 36)         | Yes      | Idempotency key for deduplication                      |
| `senderService`      | `string` (max 50)         | Yes      | Source service identifier (e.g. `"auth"`, `"billing"`) |
| `metadata`           | `Record<string, unknown>` | No       | Arbitrary key-value pairs for future use               |

All fields validated via Zod before publishing. Published to `comms.notifications` fanout exchange (empty routing key). When `publisher` is omitted during registration, the handler logs the notification and returns success (safe for tests and local dev).

See `client/COMMS_CLIENT.md` for full details.

### `D2.Comms.Client` (.NET)

Same pattern for .NET services, publishing delivery requests via raw AMQP with Protocol Buffer contracts.

## Phasing

### Phase 1: Delivery Engine (unblocks Auth sign-up flow)

- [x] Domain entities: Message, DeliveryRequest, DeliveryAttempt, ChannelPreference
- [x] Domain entities (Phase 2-3): Thread, ThreadParticipant, MessageAttachment, MessageReaction, MessageReceipt (fully implemented, not stubs)
- [x] Domain rules: channel resolution (sensitive -> email only, urgent -> bypass prefs, normal -> follow prefs), retry policy, recipient validation, message validation
- [x] App layer: Deliver handler (orchestrator), RecipientResolver, SetChannelPreference, GetChannelPreference
- [x] Infra: Drizzle schema + migrations (message, delivery_request, delivery_attempt, channel_preference)
- [x] Infra: 12 repository handlers (4 create, 5 find, 3 update)
- [x] Infra: Email provider (Resend API), SMS provider (Twilio API)
- [x] Infra: RabbitMQ notification-consumer (subscribes to `comms.notifications` fanout exchange)
- [x] Infra: DLX-based retry topology (5 tier queues with escalating TTLs)
- [x] Proto: `contracts/protos/comms/v1/comms.proto` -- full Phase 1-3 gRPC service surface
- [x] API: gRPC server (`@d2/comms-api`) -- composition root, mappers, Phase 1 handlers wired, Phase 2-3 stubs return UNIMPLEMENTED
- [x] API: `main.ts` entrypoint (gRPC server + RabbitMQ consumer)
- [x] Aspire: Auth + Comms services wired via `AddJavaScriptApp` + `.WithPnpm()`
- [x] CI: GitHub Actions jobs for comms unit + integration tests
- [x] Tests: 552 unit + integration tests passing (43 test files)
- [x] RecipientResolver: contactId via `GetContactsByIds` (contacts-only resolution)
- [x] Client: `@d2/comms-client` -- `Notify` handler publishes to `comms.notifications` fanout exchange via RabbitMQ
- [x] Markdown rendering: `marked` (17.0.3) + `isomorphic-dompurify` (2.36.0) for XSS-safe HTML email
- [x] Auth integration: verification email, password reset, invitation email -- Auth uses `@d2/comms-client`
- [x] E2E tests: 5 cross-service tests (verification, password reset, invitation for new + existing users)

### Phase 2: In-App Notifications + Push

- [ ] Notification entity + CRUD handlers
- [ ] Push via gRPC to SignalR gateway (requires gateway to exist)
- [ ] Notification history query API
- [ ] Mark as read / bulk mark as read

### Phase 3: Conversational Messaging

- [ ] Thread, ThreadParticipant, Message, MessageAttachment, MessageReaction entities
- [ ] Thread CRUD + participant management
- [ ] Message send/edit/delete
- [ ] Reactions
- [ ] Real-time thread updates via SignalR gateway
- [ ] File upload integration (MinIO)

### Phase 4: Advanced

- [ ] SMS provider integration
- [ ] Delivery analytics / dashboards
- [ ] Message search (full-text)

## Resolved Decisions

- **Email provider**: **Resend** -- best DX (clean TS SDK, `{ data, error }` pattern), 100/day free tier (never expires), $20/mo for 50K. Shared IP pool is well-managed. No dedicated IP needed at low volumes (would hurt deliverability). Trial mode for development.
- **SMS provider**: **Twilio** -- best docs/SDK in SMS space, $15 trial credit (~1,900 msgs), field service dispatch is their core vertical. Two-way SMS for worker replies. Trial mode (verified numbers only) until 10DLC registration. 10DLC requires EIN (free from IRS, no LLC needed) -- deferred until closer to beta launch (~3 week lead time for carrier approval).
- **Trial runway**: Both providers cover all development, integration testing, and small alpha (verified numbers) at $0 cost. First real spend: 10DLC registration (~$21 one-time + $2/mo) when sending SMS to unverified users.
- **No per-event sub-handlers**: Removed HandleVerificationEmail, HandlePasswordReset, HandleInvitationEmail. All notifications use the universal message shape -- the Deliver handler handles everything generically.
- **No event registry**: Removed event type -> handler dispatch mapping. The notification consumer dispatches all messages directly to the Deliver handler.
- **No template wrappers**: Removed template_wrapper table and entity. Email HTML wrapping uses a single hardcoded default template with `{{title}}`, `{{body}}`, `{{unsubscribeUrl}}` placeholders.
- **No quiet hours**: Removed from channel preferences. Channel resolution uses only `sensitive` and `urgency` fields.
- **No userId resolution**: Removed recipientUserId from DeliveryRequest. All recipients resolved via contactId only. Sending services are responsible for resolving userId -> contactId before publishing.
- **Two urgency levels only**: `"normal"` and `"urgent"` (removed `"important"`). Simple binary: respect prefs or bypass prefs.
- **Markdown rendering**: `marked` + `isomorphic-dompurify` for XSS-safe server-side HTML email rendering. No client-side rendering for transactional emails.

## Open Questions

- **SignalR gateway**: Does it already exist in the Aspire stack, or is it a new service to build?
- **File storage for attachments**: MinIO is in the Aspire stack -- confirm it's the right choice for message attachments.
- **Rate limiting on comms**: Should the delivery engine rate-limit itself per-provider (e.g., Resend has 100/day on free tier)?
- **Unsubscribe / CAN-SPAM compliance**: Marketing emails need unsubscribe links. Transactional emails don't. How do we classify?
