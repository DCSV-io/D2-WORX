# Backend Architecture & Organization

## Overview

The D²-WORX backend follows a **hierarchical, three-tier categorization system** (TLC→2LC→3LC) that provides consistent organization across all projects, from shared contracts to service-specific implementations. This structure prioritizes discoverability, maintainability, and scalability.

---

## The Three-Tier Hierarchy

### TLC (Top-Level Category)

>**What:** Primary architectural concern
>
>**Examples:** `CQRS`, `Messaging`, `Repository`, `Caching`

### 2LC (Second-Level Category)

>**What:** Implementation detail or subdivision
>
>**Examples:** `Handlers`, `MassTransit`, `Entities`, `Migrations`

### 3LC (Third-Level Category)

>**What:** Specific pattern or operation type
>
>**Examples:** `C` (Commands), `Q` (Queries), `Pub` (Publishers), `Sub` (Subscribers)

---

## Category Definitions

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands) with clear semantic boundaries.

This kind of separation is apparent throughout the application and is a core pattern in D²-WORX 
services.

**Rationale:**
- **C (Commands):** Clear intent that this operation modifies state.
- **Q (Queries):** Guarantees no side effects, safe for caching/optimization.
- **U (Utilities):** Helper operations that don't fit strict CQRS patterns.
- **X (Complex):** Complex, multistep operations that span both concerns (e.g., Get with cache population).

**Structure:**
```
CQRS/
|
|__ Handlers/
    |
    |__ C/ -> Commands (state-changing operations)
    |__ Q/ -> Queries (read-only operations)
    |__ U/ -> Utilities (neither read nor write, e.g., validation)
    |__ X/ -> Complex (operations with side effects spanning multiple concerns)
```

### Messaging (Async Event-Driven Communication)

Enables loosely-coupled service communication with pub-sub patterns using RabbitMQ/MassTransit.

**Rationale:**
- **Handlers → Pub & Sub:** Business logic remains framework-agnostic.
- **MT → Publishers & Consumers:** MassTransit-specific adapters isolated from domain logic.
- Separates MassTransit / RabbitMQ from business logic
- Enables use of interfaces to be defined by dependencies (App Layer / Contracts).

**Structure:**
```
Messaging/
|
|__ Handlers/
|   |
|   |__ Pub/ -> Publisher handlers (send messages)
|   |__ Sub/ -> Subscriber handlers (receive messages)
|
|__ MT/ -> MassTransit infrastructure
    |
    |__ Consumers/ -> MassTransit IConsumer implementations
    |__ Publishers/ -> MassTransit publisher classes (if needed)
```

### Repository (Data Access & Persistence)

Encapsulates database operations following CRUD patterns with additional infrastructure concerns.

**Rationale:**
- **CRUD separation:** Clear boundaries for each operation type.
- **Transactions at same level:** Transaction control is orthogonal to CRUD.
- **Entities/Migrations/Seeding:** Infrastructure concerns grouped together.

**Structure:**
```
Repository/
|
|__ Handlers/
|   |
|   |__ C/ -> Create operations
|   |__ R/ -> Read operations
|   |__ U/ -> Update operations
|   |__ D/ -> Delete operations
|
|__ Entities/ -> EF Core configurations
|__ Migrations/ -> Database schema evolution
|__ Seeding/ -> Initial/reference data
|__ Transactions/ -> Transaction control handlers
```

### Caching (Multi-Tier Cache Strategy)

Provides layered caching with abstract, distributed, and in-memory interfaces and implementations.

**Structure (under Interfaces):**
```
Caching/
|
|__ Abstract/ -> Base interfaces for cache operations
|   |
|   |__ Handlers/
|       |
|       |__ C/ -> Create operations
|       |__ R/ -> Read operations
|       |__ U/ -> Update operations
|       |__ D/ -> Delete operations
|
|__ Distributed/ -> Distributed cache interfaces (e.g., Redis)
|   |
|   |__ Handlers/
|       |
|       |__ C/ -> Create operations
|       |__ R/ -> Read operations
|       |__ U/ -> Update operations
|       |__ D/ -> Delete operations
|
|__ InMemory/ -> Process-local cache interfaces
    |
    |__ Handlers/
        |
        |__ C/ -> Create operations
        |__ R/ -> Read operations
        |__ U/ -> Update operations
        |__ D/ -> Delete operations
```

**Rationale:**
- **Abstract provides contracts:** Services code against interfaces.
- **Distributed vs InMemory:** Clear separation of cache tiers.
- **Same CRUD pattern:** Consistency with Repository layer.

---

## Project Types & Their Structure

### Contracts (Abstract)

**Purpose:** Define "what" without "how" - pure abstractions.

**Key Principle:** Little-to-no implementation, maximum contract definition.

**Structure:**
```
Contracts/
|
|__ Handler/ -> Base handler abstractions
|
|__ Interfaces/ -> All interface definitions following TLC hierarchy
|
|__ Messages/ -> Pure POCO message contracts (no dependencies)
|
|__ Result/ -> D2Result pattern
|
|__ Result.Extensions/ -> Extension methods for D2Result
|
|__ Utilities/ -> Shared helpers
|
|__ Tests/ -> Unit and integration tests for contracts and their implementations (for now)
```

### Contracts (Implementations)

**Purpose:** Reusable, drop-in implementations of contract interfaces.

**Key Principle:** Services consume these via DI without reinventing common functionality.

**Structure:**
```
Implementations/ -> Common reusable implementations
|
|__ Caching/ -> ...for caching
|   |
|   |__ Distributed/ -> Shared, distributed cache implementations
|   |   |
|   |   |__ DistributedCache.Redis/ -> Redis implementation
|   |
|   |__ InMemory/ -> Local, in-memory cache implementations
|       |
|       |__ InMemoryCache.Default/ -> Memory implementation
|
|__ Common/ -> Other commonly shared, drop-in implementations
|   |
|   |__ GeoRefData.Default/ -> Shared georeference logic (includes disk caching)
|
|__ Repository/ -> Common repository implementations
    |
    |__ Transactions/ -> Transaction management implementations
        |
        |__ Transactions.Pg/ -> PostgreSQL transactions
```

### Service Projects (Domain-Specific)

**Purpose:** Each service follows clean architecture with domain, application, infrastructure, and API layers.

**Key Principle:** Each service owns its data and business logic and exposes functionality via gRPC APIs with versioned contracts.

**Rationale:**
- **Domain Layer:** Completely unaware of D²-WORX or its patterns, pure business logic and data modeling.
- **App Layer:** Implements additional, more complex business logic using domain entities and interfaces representing infrastructure concerns via DI.
- **Infra Layer:** Concrete implementations of infrastructure concerns (DB, messaging, caching).
- **API Layer:** Thin gRPC layer exposing service functionality, delegating to App layer handlers. This is where everything is ultimately wired together, including DI registration.

## Practical Guidelines

### When to Create a New Category

**Add a TLC when:**
- You have a fundamentally new architectural concern (e.g., `Scheduling`)
- It would contain 3+ handler files
- It's orthogonal to existing categories

**Add a 2LC when:**
- You need to separate implementation details (e.g., `Entities`, `Migrations`)
- Infrastructure adapters need isolation (e.g., `MassTransit`)

**Add a 3LC when:**
- You're subdividing operations by type (e.g., CRUD, Pub/Sub)

### Naming Conventions

- **Folders:** PascalCase (`Handlers`, `MassTransit`)
- **TLC folders:** Match architectural concern (`CQRS`, `Messaging`, `Repository`)
- **3LC folders:** Single-letter / abbreviations (`C`, `Q`, `R`) or clear terms (`Pub`, `Sub`)
- **Files:**
  - for implementations: **match interface name** (e.g., `SetInMem.cs` for `ISetInMemHandler` interface defined in `ICommands.SetInMem.cs`)
  - for interfaces: prefix with **operation name** (e.g., `ICommands.SetInMem.cs` for `ICommands.cs` partial interface in `/Handlers/C/` folder)

### Extension Pattern

Interfaces are **partial** and split across files by operation:
```csharp
// ICommands.cs - base partial interface
public partial interface ICommands { }

// ICommands.SetInMem.cs - extends with specific handler
public partial interface ICommands 
{
    public interface ISetInMemHandler : IHandler<SetInMemInput, SetInMemOutput>;
    public record SetInMemInput(GetReferenceDataResponse Data);
    public record SetInMemOutput;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- One file per operation (easy to find)
- Grouped by common interface (discoverability)
- Clean using aliases in implementations

---

## Benefits of This Structure

### Consistency
Every project follows the same organizational pattern - once learned, navigating any project is intuitive.

### Scalability
Adding new operations, handlers, or categories follows established patterns without restructuring.

### Discoverability
File location tells you exactly what it does: `CQRS/Handlers/Q/GetSomeData.cs` is obviously a query handler.

### Testability
Clear separation between business logic (Handlers) and infrastructure (MassTransit, EF Core) enables isolated testing.

### Maintainability
Changes are localized - updating caching strategy only affects `Caching/` implementations, not consumers.

---

## Common Patterns

### Handler Registration (DI)
```csharp
// In Extensions.cs
services.AddTransient<ICommands.ISetInMemHandler, SetInMem>();
services.AddTransient<IQueries.IGetFromMemHandler, GetFromMem>();
```

### MassTransit Consumer Registration
```csharp
// In service Infra Extensions.cs
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<UpdatedConsumer>();  // Register consumers
    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.Host(rabbitMqConnectionString);
        cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
    });
});
```

### Using Aliases for Clean Implementations
This may be an odd thing to do at first, but makes handler files a lot more readable once you "get it".
```csharp
using H = ICommands.ISetInMemHandler;
using I = ICommands.SetInMemInput;
using O = ICommands.SetInMemOutput;

public class SetInMem : BaseHandler<SetInMem, I, O>, H
{
    protected override ValueTask<D2Result<O?>> ExecuteAsync(I input, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

---

## Evolution & Flexibility

This structure is **descriptive, not prescriptive**. As D²-WORX evolves:

- New TLCs can emerge (e.g., `Scheduling`, `Notifications`)
- Existing categories can be refined (e.g., splitting `X` if it grows large)
- Services can adopt patterns selectively based on their needs

The hierarchy provides **guardrails without constraints**, enabling consistent growth without rigid enforcement.
